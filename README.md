# Experiment for Clustering in Aggregate Computing

This repository contains the first experiment that explores the clustering techniques
applied in Aggregate Computing.

This work start from this [idea](https://github.com/metaphori/paper-2021-swarm-intelligence-si/blob/master/_Brainstorming/algorithm1.txt)

In [Experiments](#experiments) I briefly discuss the current state of the simulation performed.
Each entry has the form of: Name -- simulation file. For run a simulation, you can write ./gradlew run<SimulationFile> (I leave the command at the end of each section).

In [Todo](#todo) The relevant work that will have to do.
## Experiments

### Gaussian Distributions -- standardPatterns


```
./gradlew runStandardPatternsGraphic 
```


### Gaussian Overlays -- standardPatterns


```
./gradlew runStandardPatternsGraphic 
```

### Stretched Gaussian Distribution -- stretchedOutPatterns


```
./gradlew runStretchedOutPatternsGraphic 
```

### Uniform Layers Distribution -- uniformLayers

```
./gradlew runUniformLayersGraphic 
```

### Non-Convex Layers Distribution -- nonConvexLayers

```
./gradlew runUniformLayersGraphic 
```
